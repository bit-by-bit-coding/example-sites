                    Bluebells are lovely flowers that make even lovelier gifts due to thier kind meaning.
                    Bluebells are associated with humility and constancy, making them good gifts for someone you want to be with for awhile.

                <p>
                    Forget-me-nots have a meaning very similar to their name.
                    Forget-me-nots of course mean "Do not forget me", but they also mean "True love memories" making them great gifting flowers.

                <p>
                    So far we've seen what yellow Hyacinth mean, but what do Blue Hyacinths stand for?
                    Blue Hyacinth are also very similar to Bluebells as they also mean constancy.
