                    Black-eyed Susans have the lovely meaning of justice which fits the flowers yellow color.
                    Though they might have a nice meaning, justice isn't the most romantic.

                    Yellow Chrysanthemums are very unlike their red colored counterpart.
                    Yellow Chrysanthemums have a very negative connotation and are linked to disdain, disappoinment, and rejection.

                    Daffodils are a lovely gift to give to your partner or a close loved one.
                    Daffodils mean unequalled love, making them a perfect flower to give to the ones you love.

                    Fennel are a little more green than yellow, with the flowers being particularly small.
                    Even though they are not the most pretty flower, Fennel means flattery, so adding a little to your bouquet will make a great gift.

                    All Hyacinth flowers mean sport, game, or play, positive and playful but the yellow color really changes that meaning.
                    Yellow Hyacinths area symbol of jealousy, a differnet meaning from other Hyacinth flowers.

                    Marigold is yet another flower on the beautiful but negative list.
                    Marigolds mean despair, grief, and jealousy, so this doesn't make for the best gift for anyone you might like.

                    Roses are a common flower to gift to others but yellow flowers are not the best color for it.
                    Yellow roses are another flower which mean jealousy, but the flower also means a decrease of love and infidelity.

                    Though many of the yellow flowers so far have had negative meanings, Yarrow doesn't fit that mold.
