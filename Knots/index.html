                A knot is an intentional complication in cordage which may be useful or decorative. Practical knots may be classified as hitches, bends, splices, or knots. A fastens a rope to another object; a unites two rope
                ends; a is a multi-strand bend or loop.[1] A in the strictest sense serves as a stopper or knob at the end of a rope to keep that end from slipping through a grommet or eye. Knots have excited interest since ancient
                times for their practical uses, as well as their topological intricacy, studied in the area of mathematics known as knot theory.

            <p>
                Truckers in need of securing a load may use a trucker's hitch, gaining mechanical advantage. Knots can save spelunkers from being buried under rock. Many knots can also be used as makeshift tools, for example, the bowline can be used as a rescue loop, and the munter hitch can be used for belaying. The diamond hitch was widely used to tie packages on to donkeys and mules.
            </p>
            <p>
                In hazardous environments such as mountains, knots are very important. In the event of someone falling into
                a ravine or a similar terrain feature, with the correct equipment and knowledge of knots a rappel system
                can
                be set up to lower a rescuer down to a casualty and set up a hauling system to allow a third individual
                to
                pull both the rescuer and the casualty out of the ravine. Further application of knots includes
                developing a
                high line, which is similar to a zip line, and which can be used to move supplies, injured people, or
                the
                untrained across rivers, crevices, or ravines. Note the systems mentioned typically require carabiners
                and
                the use of multiple appropriate knots. These knots include the bowline, double figure eight, munter
                hitch,
                munter mule, prusik, autoblock, and clove hitch. Thus any individual who goes into a mountainous
                environment
                should have basic knowledge of knots and knot systems to increase safety and the ability to undertake
                activities such as rappelling.

            <h2>Trefoil</h2>
            <p>
                The trefoil knot is chiral, in the sense that a trefoil knot can be distinguished from its own mirror
                image.
                The two resulting variants are known as the left-handed trefoil and the right-handed trefoil. It is not
                possible to deform a left-handed trefoil continuously into a right-handed trefoil, or vice versa. (That
                is,
                the two trefoils are not ambient isotopic.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Though chiral, the trefoil knot is also invertible, meaning that there is no distinction between a
                counterclockwise-oriented and a clockwise-oriented trefoil. That is, the chirality of a trefoil depends
                only
                on the over and under crossings, not the orientation of the curve.
            </p>
            <p>
                The trefoil knot is nontrivial, meaning that it is not possible to "untie" a trefoil knot in three
                dimensions without cutting it. Mathematically, this means that a trefoil knot is not isotopic to the
                unknot.
                In particular, there is no sequence of Reidemeister moves that will untie a trefoil.
            </p>
            <p>
                Proving this requires the construction of a knot invariant that distinguishes the trefoil from the
                unknot.
                The simplest such invariant is tricolorability: the trefoil is tricolorable, but the unknot is not. In
                addition, virtually every major knot polynomial distinguishes the trefoil from an unknot, as do most
                other
                strong knot invariants.
            </p>
            <p>
                In knot theory, the trefoil is the first nontrivial knot, and is the only knot with crossing number
                three.
                It is a prime knot, and is listed as 31 in the Alexander-Briggs notation. The Dowker notation for the
                trefoil is 4 6 2, and the Conway notation is [3].

            <h2>Tangles</h2>
            <p>
                In mathematics, a tangle is generally one of two related concepts:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In John Conway's definition, an -tangle is a proper embedding of the disjoint union of arcs into a
                    3-ball; the embedding must send the endpoints of the arcs to 2 marked points on the ball's boundary.
                </li>
                <li>In link theory, a tangle is an embedding of arcs and circles into {\displaystyle \mathbf {R}
                    ^{2}\times
                    [0,1]} {\mathbf {R}}^{2}\times [0,1] – the difference from the previous definition is that it
                    includes
                    circles as well as arcs, and partitions the boundary into two (isomorphic) pieces, which is
                    algebraically more convenient – it allows one to add tangles by stacking them, for instance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                An arbitrary tangle diagram of a rational tangle may look very complicated, but there is always a
                diagram of
                a particular simple form: start with a tangle diagram consisting of two horizontal (vertical) arcs; add
                a
                "twist", i.e. a single crossing by switching the NE and SE endpoints (SW and SE endpoints); continue by
                adding more twists using either the NE and SE endpoints or the SW and SE endpoints. One can suppose each
                twist does not change the diagram inside a disc containing previously created crossings.
