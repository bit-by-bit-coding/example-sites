        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            A knot is an intentional complication in cordage which may be useful or decorative. Practical knots may be
            classified as hitches, bends, splices, or knots. A fastens a rope to another object; a unites two rope ends;
            a is a multi-strand bend or loop.[1] A in the strictest sense serves as a stopper or knob at the end of a
            rope to keep that end from slipping through a grommet or eye. Knots have excited interest since ancient
            times for their practical uses, as well as their topological intricacy, studied in the area of mathematics
            known as knot theory. </p>
        <p>
            Truckers in need of securing a load may use a trucker's hitch, gaining mechanical advantage. Knots can save
            spelunkers from being buried under rock. Many knots can also be used as makeshift tools, for example, the
            bowline can be used as a rescue loop, and the munter hitch can be used for belaying. The diamond hitch was
            widely used to tie packages on to donkeys and mules.
        </p>
        <p>
            In hazardous environments such as mountains, knots are very important. In the event of someone falling into
            a ravine or a similar terrain feature, with the correct equipment and knowledge of knots a rappel system can
            be set up to lower a rescuer down to a casualty and set up a hauling system to allow a third individual to
            pull both the rescuer and the casualty out of the ravine. Further application of knots includes developing a
            high line, which is similar to a zip line, and which can be used to move supplies, injured people, or the
            untrained across rivers, crevices, or ravines. Note the systems mentioned typically require carabiners and
            the use of multiple appropriate knots. These knots include the bowline, double figure eight, munter hitch,
            munter mule, prusik, autoblock, and clove hitch. Thus any individual who goes into a mountainous environment
            should have basic knowledge of knots and knot systems to increase safety and the ability to undertake
            activities such as rappelling.

    <!-- Trefoil -->
    <div id="trefoil" class="content">
        <h2>Trefoil</h2>
        <p>
            <img id="trefoildrawing" alt="drawing of a trefoil knot"
                src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Trefoil_knot_left.svg/1024px-Trefoil_knot_left.svg.png">
            The trefoil knot is chiral, in the sense that a trefoil knot can be distinguished from its own mirror image.
            The two resulting variants are known as the left-handed trefoil and the right-handed trefoil. It is not
            possible to deform a left-handed trefoil continuously into a right-handed trefoil, or vice versa. (That is,
            the two trefoils are not ambient isotopic.)

            Though chiral, the trefoil knot is also invertible, meaning that there is no distinction between a
            counterclockwise-oriented and a clockwise-oriented trefoil. That is, the chirality of a trefoil depends only
            on the over and under crossings, not the orientation of the curve.
        </p>
        <p>
            The trefoil knot is nontrivial, meaning that it is not possible to "untie" a trefoil knot in three
            dimensions without cutting it. Mathematically, this means that a trefoil knot is not isotopic to the unknot.
            In particular, there is no sequence of Reidemeister moves that will untie a trefoil.

            Proving this requires the construction of a knot invariant that distinguishes the trefoil from the unknot.
            The simplest such invariant is tricolorability: the trefoil is tricolorable, but the unknot is not. In
            addition, virtually every major knot polynomial distinguishes the trefoil from an unknot, as do most other
            strong knot invariants.


        </p>
        <p>
            In knot theory, the trefoil is the first nontrivial knot, and is the only knot with crossing number three.
            It is a prime knot, and is listed as 31 in the Alexander-Briggs notation. The Dowker notation for the
            trefoil is 4 6 2, and the Conway notation is [3].

            The trefoil can be described as the (2,3)-torus knot. It is also the knot obtained by closing the braid σ13.

            The trefoil is an alternating knot. However, it is not a slice knot, meaning it does not bind a smooth
            2-dimensional disk in the 4-dimensional ball; one way to prove this is to note that its signature is not
            zero. Another proof is that its Alexander polynomial does not satisfy the Fox-Milnor condition.

    <div id="tangles" class="content">
        <h2>Tangles</h2>
        <img id="tangledrawing" alt="tangle"

        <p>
            In mathematics, a tangle is generally one of two related concepts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In John Conway's definition, an -tangle is a proper embedding of the disjoint union of arcs into a
                3-ball; the embedding must send the endpoints of the arcs to 2 marked points on the ball's boundary.
            </li>
            <li>In link theory, a tangle is an embedding of arcs and circles into {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{2}\times
                [0,1]} {\mathbf {R}}^{2}\times [0,1] – the difference from the previous definition is that it includes
                circles as well as arcs, and partitions the boundary into two (isomorphic) pieces, which is
                algebraically more convenient – it allows one to add tangles by stacking them, for instance.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            An arbitrary tangle diagram of a rational tangle may look very complicated, but there is always a diagram of
            a particular simple form: start with a tangle diagram consisting of two horizontal (vertical) arcs; add a
            "twist", i.e. a single crossing by switching the NE and SE endpoints (SW and SE endpoints); continue by
            adding more twists using either the NE and SE endpoints or the SW and SE endpoints. One can suppose each
            twist does not change the diagram inside a disc containing previously created crossings.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can describe such a diagram by considering the numbers given by consecutive twists around the same set of
            endpoints, e.g. (2, 1, -3) means start with two horizontal arcs, then 2 twists using NE/SE endpoints, then 1
            twist using SW/SE endpoints, and then 3 twists using NE/SE endpoints but twisting in the opposite direction
            from before. The list begins with 0 if you start with two vertical arcs. The diagram with two horizontal
            arcs is then (0), but we assign (0, 0) to the diagram with vertical arcs. A convention is needed to describe
            a "positive" or "negative" twist. Often, "rational tangle" refers to a list of numbers representing a simple
            diagram as described.
