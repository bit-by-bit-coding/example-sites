                A knot is an intentional complication in cordage which may be useful or decorative. Practical knots may be classified as hitches, bends, splices, or knots. A fastens a rope to another object; a unites two rope
                ends; a is a multi-strand bend or loop.[1] A in the strictest sense serves as a stopper or knob at the end of a rope to keep that end from slipping through a grommet or eye. Knots have excited interest since ancient
                times for their practical uses, as well as their topological intricacy, studied in the area of mathematics known as knot theory.

                The trefoil knot is chiral, in the sense that a trefoil knot can be distinguished from its own mirror
                image.
                The two resulting variants are known as the left-handed trefoil and the right-handed trefoil. It is not
                possible to deform a left-handed trefoil continuously into a right-handed trefoil, or vice versa. (That
                is,
                the two trefoils are not ambient isotopic.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Though chiral, the trefoil knot is also invertible, meaning that there is no distinction between a
                counterclockwise-oriented and a clockwise-oriented trefoil. That is, the chirality of a trefoil depends
                only
                on the over and under crossings, not the orientation of the curve.
            </p>
            <p>
                The trefoil knot is nontrivial, meaning that it is not possible to "untie" a trefoil knot in three
                dimensions without cutting it. Mathematically, this means that a trefoil knot is not isotopic to the
                unknot.
                In particular, there is no sequence of Reidemeister moves that will untie a trefoil.

            <h1>Tangles</h1>
            <p>
                In mathematics, a tangle is generally one of two related concepts:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In John Conway's definition, an -tangle is a proper embedding of the disjoint union of arcs into a
                    3-ball; the embedding must send the endpoints of the arcs to 2 marked points on the ball's boundary.
                </li>
                <li>In link theory, a tangle is an embedding of arcs and circles into {\displaystyle \mathbf {R}
                    ^{2}\times
                    [0,1]} {\mathbf {R}}^{2}\times [0,1] – the difference from the previous definition is that it
                    includes
                    circles as well as arcs, and partitions the boundary into two (isomorphic) pieces, which is
                    algebraically more convenient – it allows one to add tangles by stacking them, for instance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                An arbitrary tangle diagram of a rational tangle may look very complicated, but there is always a
                diagram of
                a particular simple form: start with a tangle diagram consisting of two horizontal (vertical) arcs; add
                a
                "twist", i.e. a single crossing by switching the NE and SE endpoints (SW and SE endpoints); continue by
                adding more twists using either the NE and SE endpoints or the SW and SE endpoints. One can suppose each
                twist does not change the diagram inside a disc containing previously created crossings.

    Do you usually put p tags in a div? 
    What about design?

    User experience -- ie changing things when clicked

    change cursor icon when dragging/dropping things or when waiting
    Change cursor icon

    Design languages -- cohesive style guides that big copmanies use
        e.g. Google's material design
    create a cohesive-looking feel
    Material: never bends/folds, not transparent, but does layer on top of each other
        Colors occasionally but tend to be playful but not too bright or pastel
        When you Google color picker it randomly goes to a color in Google's logo!
        IBM has a strong design language

    vendor prefixes

    mobile browsers
        1. Mobile first
        2. Non-mobile first

    Progressive enhancement
    Graceful degradation

    Talk about the % unit more -- either the width or the height depending on if you're setting the width or the height
    vw and vh as units -- percent of the entire width of the window or percent of the entire height

    media queries
    @media -- special styles for when the screen is more like a smartphone vs not small like that
